## Installation

1. Git Python
2. Git the `main.py` script.
3. Git a global shortcut to run the script (`python path/to/main.py`).
4. Git a GitLab Personal Access Token and input it once.

## How to Use It

1. Run the script or assign a global shortcut.
2. Type a project name or a namespace/group (a few letters will do).
3. If there's only one match, you're there.
4. If there's more than one match, you'll be prompted to select one.
5. In any case, you now saved 2 clicks and a few seconds of your life.
